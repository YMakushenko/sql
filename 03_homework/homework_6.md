**Write**: Reflect on your previous work and how you would adjust to include ethics and inequity components. Total length should be a few paragraphs, no more than one page.

Reflecting on my previous work at a bank, I realize the importance of including ethics and equity in data science. Banks handle huge amounts of sensitive data, and it's crucial to use this data responsibly and fairly. During my time at the bank, our primary focus was often on efficiency, profitability, and risk management. We dealt with sensitive personal and financial information daily. This included data access for employees, top management, and shareholders. Unfortunately, there were instances of fraud, which highlighted the need for strong ethical practices.

One major ethical concern was the potential for fraud and misuse of data. To address this, it was essential to implement strict security measures. Each employee had a personal ID, which helped trace any fraudulent activities. Only employees who need specific information to do their jobs had access to it. Regular audits and monitoring can also help detect and prevent unauthorized access.

Incorporating ethics in data science means being transparent about how data is collected, used, and shared. At the bank, we often used customer data to create models for credit scoring, loan approvals, and targeted marketing. Thatâ€™s why we had transparent communication with customers about how their data is used. This transparency builds trust and allows customers to make informed decisions about their data.

We also had regular audits of our data and algorithms to check for bias. This includes diversifying our datasets and ensuring that our models are fair and equitable for all customers.

In summary, my experience at the bank has shown me the critical role of ethics and equity in data science. By being transparent, actively addressing biases, and fostering a culture of ethical awareness, we can use data to benefit everyone fairly and responsibly. These steps are important to ensure that data science practices do not perpetuate existing inequalities but rather contribute to a more equitable future.
